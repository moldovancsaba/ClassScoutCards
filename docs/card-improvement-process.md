# Card Improvement Process (SOP)

Status: v1, first version. This document is itself expected to change as we learn from real runs —
update it in place when a rule proves wrong or a new failure mode is discovered, and note the change
in the changelog at the bottom rather than silently rewriting history.

## Purpose

An ongoing, never-ending loop that revisits ClassScout content cards — always the oldest-updated card
in the pool first — learns what the card actually is, researches the real organization/program behind
it, and either improves it or explicitly confirms it needs no improvement. Every pass through the loop
is recorded, even when nothing changed, so the queue rotates and "reviewed" is always distinguishable
from "never looked at."

This is not a one-time cleanup. It runs forever, card after card, as the pool grows and as the rules
below get corrected from real mistakes.

## The loop

1. **Pull** the single oldest-updated card from the pool (`GET /api/card-bridge/rows`, no filter,
   `limit=1`, or `?state=X` when working a specific queue). Selection is always `updatedAt asc,
   <idField> asc` — the same canonical ordering every lane in the main app uses. Never hand-pick a
   card out of order.
2. **Learn** the card's current stored state: every field the bridge's read projection exposes,
   including `enrichmentSummary` (what the pipeline already extracted) and, for family-service cards,
   the linked `serviceLeads`/`servicePlaceFacts`/`serviceTasks` records (see "Cross-collection lookups"
   below) — the content card is frequently NOT the only record for the same real-world entity.
3. **Research** the real organization/program. At minimum, fetch the card's own `sourceUrl` fresh —
   never rely solely on `enrichmentSummary.sourceTextSample`, which may be stale or truncated. Prefer
   corroborating with a second source (web search) when the first source is thin, ambiguous, or the
   card's stored facts look wrong. **Never fabricate a fact that isn't source-backed.** If research
   can't confirm something, that is itself the finding — record it as a gap, don't guess.
4. **Decide: enrich, fix, or leave as-is.** Compare researched facts against the four in-scope quality
   properties (category/activity classification, age/schedule/location, image presence & integrity,
   public copy quality) and the card's own state-machine correctness (Decision Matrix A below). A
   correction is only made when research provides real evidence for it — "the existing value might be
   wrong" is not enough; "the source page now clearly says X" is.
5. **Decide: block / draft / publish / leave.** Maps to the card's own `state` field (Decision Matrix
   B). **This bridge can never set `state="PUBLISHED"`** — that requires the main app's full publish
   gate (dedupe, schema validation, image pipeline, safe-publish flags), which this bridge does not
   replicate and must not bypass. The strongest outcome available here is `REVIEW_READY` — handing off
   to whatever process owns real publication.
6. **Touch, always.** Every pass through the loop stamps `updatedAt` + `lastReviewedAt` +
   `lastReviewedBy`, even when step 4/5 concluded "leave as-is." Use `touch: true` on the write request
   when there is no content change to make — never skip the write just because nothing needed fixing.
   Skipping this step breaks the queue: the same "already fine" card would keep coming up first forever.
7. **Persist.** `POST /api/card-bridge/update`, `dryRun: false` to actually commit. Every applied write
   (touch or content change) is recorded in `cardBridgeAuditLog` with the pre-image, `reason`, and
   `source` — this is the only audit trail; there is no way to write through this bridge without one.
8. **Go to 1.**

## Decision Matrix A — enrich / fix / leave (step 4)

| Finding from research | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Stored facts match the source; no defect in any of the 4 properties | Leave as-is; touch only |
| A stored field is wrong or stale, and the fresh source clearly gives the correct value | Enrich: write the corrected, allow-listed field(s), with `reason` citing what changed and why |
| Copy contains a defect (`validateCopyQuality`: URL leak, scraped chrome, placeholder, un-decoded entity, too short) | Fix: rewrite from the source's real content — never patch symptomatically (e.g. never just strip the bad substring and leave a fragment) |
| Source is dead / unreachable / doesn't support the card's facts at all | Do not fabricate a fix. Move to Decision Matrix B (block) |
| A field is genuinely absent from *every* available source (not just this one) | Leave the gap recorded (`incompleteFields` / `blockerCodes`), do not invent a value |
| The card's real record lives partly in another collection (e.g. a `FamilyServiceLead`) and THAT record has the actual defect | Report it — see "Explicit boundaries," this bridge does not yet write `serviceLeads`/`servicePlaceFacts` |

## Decision Matrix B — block / draft / publish / leave (step 5, `contentCards.state`)

| Outcome | `state` to set | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leave | unchanged | Card is correctly positioned in its current state; nothing to advance |
| Draft | `REVIEW_READY` | Research confirms the card is accurate and complete enough for a human/next-stage decision — the strongest outcome this bridge can set |
| Block (repairable) | `BLOCKED_REPAIRABLE` + `blockerCodes` | A specific, nameable gap exists that a future pass (or a different process) could plausibly fix |
| Block (terminal) | `BLOCKED_TERMINAL` + `terminalReason` | Source is confirmed dead, the entity doesn't exist, or it's clearly out of scope (e.g. not actually a family/kids activity) |
| Publish | **never** — reject at the API layer | Real publication is the main app's job. Setting `REVIEW_READY` is the correct hand-off; do not try to shortcut it |

## Cross-collection lookups (before deciding anything)

Before acting on a `contentCard`, check whether a linked record exists elsewhere — acting on the
content card alone when the real defect is in a linked record wastes the pass and can produce a
misleading audit trail:

- `sourcePool: "family_service"` / `entityKindHint: "familyService"` → look up the matching
  `serviceLeads` row by `sourceUrl` (exact match via `filter`). If one exists, its `status` and
  `serviceKind`/`tags`/`amenities` are the authoritative record for that entity, not the content card's
  own `categoryHint`/`blockerCodes`.
- A stuck/orphaned card with `enrichmentStatus: "valid_source_ready"` and zero blockers that hasn't
  moved in a long time is often a *pipeline* problem (a dead task queue, a routing gap), not a
  *content* problem — don't force a per-card fix for what is actually a systemic gap. Write a
  recommendation (see the project's recommendation convention) instead of papering over it card by card.

## Explicit boundaries (v1 — revisit as capability grows)

- **No real publication.** `state` can never be set to `PUBLISHED` through this bridge.
- **`serviceLeads` / `servicePlaceFacts` are read-only.** Their status/visibility transitions have real
  business-logic invariants (`src/lib/familyServices/core.ts` in the main app) this bridge doesn't yet
  reproduce. Do not attempt to advance a lead's status through raw field writes — report it as a
  recommendation until this bridge has real support for that state machine.
- **No automated "research" step yet.** Step 3 today is performed by whoever/whatever is driving the
  loop (a person, an agent) fetching the source and reasoning about it — there is no wired-in LLM call
  inside the bridge itself. Automating step 3 unattended (e.g. via Vercel Cron) needs a hosted LLM
  API call from the serverless function, which is a real cost + provider decision — proposed, not yet
  built. Until then, this loop runs one iteration at a time, driven explicitly.

## Running the loop today

There is no autopilot yet — each iteration is driven explicitly:

```
GET  /api/card-bridge/rows?collection=contentCards&limit=1          # step 1
# steps 2-5 performed by whoever/whatever is driving this iteration
POST /api/card-bridge/update                                        # steps 6-7
  { "collection": "contentCards", "id": "...", "touch": true,
    "updates": { ... only if something actually changed ... },
    "reason": "...", "source": "...", "dryRun": false }
```

Always dry-run first (`dryRun` defaults to `true` — no flag needed) to review the diff before
committing.

## Changelog

- v1 (2026-08-06): first version, written after tracing the family-services pipeline stall and adding
  `touch` + content-card `state` write support to the bridge specifically to support this loop.
